## AUI Project Magic Orchestra

*Magic Orchestra* is a brain training activity in a magic room.

*Magic Orchestra* is composed of three games that are proposed to the user in a storytelling mode.
In our game, the user is an orchestra director that has to manage, with the advice of the owner of the theatre, all the activities to prepare the concert.

All the activities proposed to the user are **scalable in difficulty** (with some parameters decidable from the caregiver) and they can be played separately, without the context of Magic Orchestra.
