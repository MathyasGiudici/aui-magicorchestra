*Magic Orchestra* is a software designed for smart spaces and multi-sensory environments which is made up of three games: InstruMaps, Quanti Numeri (many numbers in English) and Sinfonia di Luci (Symphony of lights in English). 
The tool affects the branch of brain-training related to memory; indeed, each game addresses a different part of memory and requires to perform different actions inside the smart space, interacting with different objects and moving around the room.
*Magic Orchestra* takes the name from the theme around which it is built: an orchestra composed of magic instruments that the user has to manage, just like a real maestro.
*Magic Orchestra* has been thought to be played as a single game with a story mode (guided-tour pattern) or as three split games (index pattern), which are still related to the theme of an orchestra.
Moreover, we have inserted an important feature that allows playing the three games without a context, so with a very aseptic design, that could be interesting for research on advantages or disadvantages of contextualization of brain-training activities.
All the activities of *Magic Orchestra* have different parameters that could be set by the caregivers to make the user comfortable during the activity but also to make the exercise challenging and useful.
